  * Use the Token Bridge address `0x4aa42145Aa6Ebf72e164C9bBC74fbD3788045016` as the recipient of the payment.
* Wait for transaction confirmation in the ETH Mainnet \(transaction time depends on the gas price you setup for the transfer transaction and the network throughput\).
* Wait for the relay confirmation by the bridge validators \(time depends on the number of blocks \ the bridge validators wait for to consider the chain finalized, currently set at  `8`\).
* Check your balance on the xDai chain.
