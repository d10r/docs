# Multi-token extension \(testing\)

This is a test version of the Multi-token AMB extension. It can be used if an application would like to better understand the principles of transferring the tokens to another chain.

Almost everything that it is applicable for [the extension between the Ethereum Mainnet and xDai chain ](../eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension/)\could be applied to this extension. Refer to the documentation section that provides lots of useful information on managing the extension: ["Multi-token extension"](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/multi-token-extension).
