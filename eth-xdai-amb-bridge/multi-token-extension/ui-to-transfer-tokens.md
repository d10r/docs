# OmniBridge UI

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ‘· The OmniBridge UI is currently under construction. Check back soon for updates. 
{% endhint %}

At the moment, there is no uniform UI to allow users to transfer tokens through the AMB multi-token extension. One option for a token owner \(without programming knowledge\) is to use [solUI](https://solui.dev/).

Here is an [example application where users can transfer JOON tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to the xDai chain and back](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMZEEZX7GF4d82AYvX8CsoNQh5v9vPZfs7CdK7s8XkzV/#l=./dapp-e145213f89.json).
