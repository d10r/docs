# Bridge Fees

There are currently no fees for users when bridging between xDai and Ethereum. Fees are subsidized by the validators. In future iterations, a small fee may be introduced to cover expenses incurred when sending transactions from xDai to Ethereum. 

Current thinking on exit fees will be .05%. This is subject to change as we continue with bridge development.
